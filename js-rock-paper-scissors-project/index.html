<!-- Your game looks good! Here are a few suggestions that you could add to improve your game further:

Score Tracking: You could add a score tracker to the game that keeps track of how many times the user wins, loses or ties with the computer.

Reset Button: You could add a reset button that allows the user to reset the game and start over.

Sound Effects: Adding sound effects to the game can make it more engaging and exciting.

Animations: Adding animations to the buttons and the result can enhance the user experience and make the game more visually appealing.

Difficulty Levels: You could add difficulty levels to the game by adjusting the probability of the computer making certain choices. For example, the computer could be more likely to choose rock on an easy level and more likely to choose scissors on a harder level.

I hope these suggestions help you to take your game to the next level! -->
